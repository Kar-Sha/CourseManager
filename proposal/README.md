## Problem
The problem we are trying to solve is the issue of tracking the courses you’ve taken and those that need to be taken by a student. Often, students have trouble figuring out the next courses they need to take for the next semester. Or sometimes students take the wrong courses that cause them to fall behind in attaining their degree. So the issue here to be resolved is to provide students with a more interactive and easier platform where students can utilize our app to devise their degree plans.

### Assumptions/Operating Environment/Intended Usage
The assumption is that the user is intending to enroll into college and complete their course plan. The operating environment will be accessible as a web application.

## High Level Solution and Functionality
After the user enters their school, the user will be prompted to sign in or register. When registering the user would provide the necessary information such as name, student ID, birthdate, home location, grade, major, and GPA. After that the app will then help devise a four year plan that ensures the student can graduate on time. As the user completes their courses, the app will recommend courses to be taken for their next semester depending on their intended units and if they want to take a winter, summer, or gap semester. This allows for our app to prevent the need to go to a counselor or a major advisor for suggestions of future courses which can take a long time to hear a response from. On another page of the app we can have a chart that keeps track of the units taken to units needed for graduation such as a pie chart so it’s visually appealing to the student and easy to comprehend.
